# Deploy Your Keto Diet Tracker from GitHub

## Step 1: Deploy on Railway (Recommended)

1. **Go to Railway**
   - Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "Login" 
   - Select "Login with GitHub"
   - Authorize Railway to access your repositories

2. **Deploy Your Repository**
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Find and select your `keto-diet-tracker` repository
   - Railway will automatically detect your `railway.json` configuration
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Wait for Deployment**
   - Deployment takes 2-3 minutes
   - You'll see build logs in real-time
   - Once complete, you'll get a public URL

4. **Test Your App**
   - Click the generated URL
   - Your Keto Diet Tracker will be live!
   - Test the health endpoints: `/health`, `/ping`

## Alternative Options

### Option 2: Render
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Web Service"
4. Connect your repository
5. Render detects your `render.yaml` automatically

### Option 3: Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Import your project
4. Vercel uses your `vercel.json` configuration

## What Happens After Deployment

- You get a public URL (like: `https://your-app.railway.app`)
- Automatic redeployments when you push changes to GitHub
- Built-in monitoring and logs
- Free tier with generous limits
- SSL certificate included

## If Deployment Fails

Check these common issues:
- Ensure `simple-server.js` is in your repository
- Verify `railway.json` (or `render.yaml`) is present
- Check that `package.json` has all dependencies

Your app is fully configured and ready - the deployment should work smoothly!
